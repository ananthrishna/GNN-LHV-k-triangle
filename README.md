# Multipartite Triangle Network Causal Structure encoded to Classical Ranked Neural Network Model 

Code for article "Is genuine nonlocality in the triangle network exclusive to pure states?"
https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08079

Detail sections be added soon..

There are two sections of code
- one which i use for testing - there are both a) LHV & b) LHV-k rank models
- and the other which has been segmented for ease and to be run parallely on a cluster, this includes a batch script to run the same for results. 
- I have also added graph segemnts to show the results

You can retrieve the values of the resoponse functions that were found after training the neural network model to replicate the target distribution, and check for it manually. Since if the response function can succesfully replicate the target distribution, then the distribution can be explained local-realistically.

Please download the values from the Gdrive here. And you can find the python notebook file with the code to check if its local realistic here.
